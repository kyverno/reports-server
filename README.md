# Reports Server

Reports server provides a scalable solution for storing policy reports and cluster policy reports. It moves reports out of etcd and stores them in a PostgreSQL database instance.

## Why reports server?

It is desirable to move reports out of etcd for several reasons:

Why leave etcd:

- The etcd database currently has a maximum size of 8GB. Reports tend to be relatively large objects, but even with very small reports, the etcd capacity can be easily reached in larger clusters with many report producers.
- Under heavy report activity (e.g. cluster churn, scanning, analytical processes, etc.), the volume of data being written and retrieved by etcd requires the API server to buffer large amounts of data. This compounds existing cluster issues and can cascade into complete API unavailability.
- CAP guarantees are not required for reports, which, at present, are understood to be ephemeral data that will be re-created if deleted.
- Philosophically, report data is analytical in nature and should not be stored in the transactional database.

Benefits of reports server:

- Alleviation of the etcd + API server load and capacity limitations.
- Common report consumer workflows can be more efficient.
    - Report consumers are often analytical and/or operate on aggregate data. The API is not designed to efficiently handle, for example, a query for all reports where containing a vulnerability with a CVSS severity of 8.0 or above. To perform such a query, a report consumer must retrieve and parse all of the reports. Retrieving a large volume of reports, especially with multiple simultaneous consumers, leads to the performance issues described previously.
    - With reports stored in a relational database, report consumers could instead query the underlying database directly, using more robust query syntax.
    - This would improve the implementation of, or even replace the need for, certain exporters, and enable new reporting use cases.

## Installation

The reports server can be installed in a test cluster, directly from the YAML manifest or via the official Helm chart. 

### Local Install
To locally install the reports server, run the following command:

```shell
# create a local kind cluster
make kind-create

# build docker images, load images in kind cluster, and deploy helm chart
make kind-install
```

### YAML Manifest
To install the latest reports server release from the config/install.yaml manifest, run the following command.
```shell
kubectl apply -f config/install.yaml # todo: use a release url
```

### Helm Chart
Reports server can be installed via the official Helm chart:
```shell
helm install report-server --namespace kyverno --wait ./charts/reports-server/ # todo: use a offical helm chart
```

Note: if you already have wgpolicy CRDs or kyverno CRDs installed, you won't be able to install api services. Use the following command to install other components:

```shell
helm install report-server --namespace kyverno --wait ./charts/reports-server/ --set apiServices.enabled=false # todo: use a offical helm chart
```

Now you can update the [apiservice samples](./config/samples/apiservices.yaml) with the right reports-server name and namespace and apply that manifest.
